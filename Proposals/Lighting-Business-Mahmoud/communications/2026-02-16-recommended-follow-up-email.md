Updated Proposal + Recommended Start Option (Option C)

## Email Body
Hi Mahmoud,

Thank you for today’s meeting.

Based on our discussion, we updated the proposal to match your exact priorities:
- Focus on mosque/project chandelier segment (not broad consumer traffic)
- Cost-effective acquisition model with clear ROI tracking
- Fixed non-partnership options clearly separated

### Recommended start for your case
We recommend **Option C (Fixed Optimize, No Sharing)**:
- **35,000 EGP** setup (one-time)
- **17,500 EGP/month** (minimum 3 months)
- Includes channel execution and optimization (not just build)
- You keep 100% ownership, with no equity/profit sharing

### Why this is the best starting point
- You asked for a practical system that drives qualified opportunities, not only a website/funnel handover.
- This model gives enough time to test channels and optimize based on data.

### 90-day baseline
- Week 1-2: positioning, ICP mapping, offer architecture, tracking foundation
- Week 3-6: launch search + outbound acquisition and lead capture flow
- Week 7-12: optimization, channel reallocation, quote pipeline acceleration

If you approve, we can schedule kickoff immediately and start implementation.

Best,
Fouad
