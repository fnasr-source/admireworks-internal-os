## 6. Market Opportunity Assessment

### Where Meguiar's Egypt Can Win
1. **Digital-first brand presence** — nobody is doing it well yet
2. **Content authority** — educational detailing content in Arabic
3. **Community leadership** — build THE Egyptian car care community
4. **E-commerce** — be the first premium brand to sell directly online in Egypt
5. **Influencer partnerships** — no competitor has activated this channel

### Where They're Vulnerable
1. **Price-sensitive market** — Egyptian consumers may trade down to Turtle Wax/Armor All
2. **Parallel imports** — products available on Ubuy/Amazon outside distributor control
3. **3M dynamics** — parent company products competing in same market
4. **Local brands** — lower cost, potentially better distribution
