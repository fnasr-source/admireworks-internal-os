## Dear Mahmoud,

Following our discovery session, we've completed a deep market intelligence exercise on the Egyptian and Saudi lighting landscape.
**The Ask:** Turn the "Lighting Consultant" concept into a live business without technical headaches.
**The Solution:** A 90-day "Launchpad" sprint to build brand, tech, and sales pipeline.
**The Investment:** Hybrid Model (Low Risk, High Alignment)
*   **Setup:** 32,000 EGP (One-time)
*   **Retainer:** 12,000 EGP (Monthly)
*   **Success Fee:** 10% of Net Profit

## 1. The Insight

The lighting market's biggest player online — **enarat.com** — sells products. Nobody sells **confidence**. Buyers don't need more options. They need someone to say: *"This one. For your room. I'm sure."*

Your brand will be the first to do this at scale.

## 5. Why Admireworks?

We don't just build websites — we build **business models**.

*   ✅ We researched enarat.com's weaknesses before you asked us to.
*   ✅ We identified the $110B Saudi Vision 2030 opportunity and the specific architecture firms to target.
*   ✅ We proved Egypt's Meta ad costs are **17-27x cheaper** than global averages — your $500/month = 850,000 impressions.
*   ✅ We understand the commercial engine, not just the code.

**We didn't prepare a generic proposal. We prepared a strategy.**
