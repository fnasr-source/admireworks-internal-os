## Research Basis (Already Completed)

This offer is based on:
- `02-Research-Report.md`
- `03-Competitor-Scan.md`
- `04-Options-and-Recommendation.md`
- `08-Appendix-Sources.md`

Core thesis: win by selling **confidence and guided decision-making** (Lighting Stylist), then expand through **Projects KSA**.

## Meeting Update (February 16, 2026)

The latest meeting clarified the operating model:
- Primary segment focus: mosque/project chandelier buyers (high-intent, project-led demand)
- Priority: cost-effective acquisition and measurable ROI, not broad awareness traffic
- Commercial preference: fixed non-partnership structure is important to keep available

---

## Recommendation (Current)

Recommended to start now: **Option C (Fixed Optimize, No Sharing)**.

Why this is recommended for this case:
- It matches the request for active channel management and optimization (not build-only handover).
- It preserves full ownership (no equity transfer, no profit sharing).
- It gives a practical 3-month runway to validate acquisition economics before scaling.

Fallback paths:
- Choose **Option A** if you want aligned upside with lower fixed monthly cost.
- Choose **Option B** if you want one-time fixed delivery with no ongoing management.

---

## Baseline 90-Day Execution

1. **Weeks 1-2:** ICP and segment mapping, value proposition, keyword and outreach architecture, tracking setup.
2. **Weeks 3-6:** Launch high-intent search + direct outreach + lead routing and follow-up flows.
3. **Weeks 7-12:** Optimize by channel performance, improve qualification, accelerate quote pipeline.

Core KPIs:
- Qualified leads by channel
- Cost per qualified lead
- Meetings booked
- Quotations issued
- Win rate by segment

---

## Next Steps (Start-Ready)

1. Confirm **Option C** (or choose Option A/B if preferred).
2. Process initial payment based on selected option.
3. Schedule kickoff and begin Week 1 execution.
