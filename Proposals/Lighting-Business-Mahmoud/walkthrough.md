# Walkthrough: The "Lighting Stylist" Strategy

## Completed Mission
We have successfully decoded the "Anti-Mousky" brief and delivered a comprehensive Strategy & Proposal package for Sara Selim.

### Key Insights Unlocked
1.  **The "Enrod" Myth:** The client's reference was likely a misheard "Al-Andalus" or "Enlighten." This confirms **Low Brand Recall** in the market -> Massive Opportunity for a new brand.
2.  **The "Saudi Gap":** Saudi needs 320,000 hotel rooms. Egyptian manufacturers (Kandil/Asfour) are *barely* targeting this digital export channel.
3.  **The Winning Model:** **"The Decision Engine."** Don't just sell lights; sell the *certainty* that they fit.

## Evidence Captured
We proved the "Service Gap" by auditing the giants:
*   **Kandil:** Boring Policy (No interaction) -> ![Evidence](/Users/user/Documents/IDE Projects/Internal AW SOP/proposals/Sara-Selim/assets/screenshots/kandil_refund_policy_1770676388983.png)
*   **Asfour:** No Export to KSA -> ![Evidence](/Users/user/Documents/IDE Projects/Internal AW SOP/proposals/Sara-Selim/assets/screenshots/asfour_shipping_destinations_1770676779632.png)
*   **Homzmart:** Cluttered/Low Trust -> ![Evidence](/Users/user/Documents/IDE Projects/Internal AW SOP/proposals/Sara-Selim/assets/screenshots/homzmart_product_page_services_1770677460072.png)
*   **IKEA:** No Light Planner -> ![Evidence](/Users/user/Documents/IDE Projects/Internal AW SOP/proposals/Sara-Selim/assets/screenshots/ikea_self_planning_tools_confirmed_1770678120983.png)

## Immediate Next Steps (Meeting Agenda)
1.  **Confirm the Gap:** Ask Sara: *"Have you noticed that no one helps you 'pick' the light?"*
2.  **Present the "Decision Engine":** Show the "Quiz" flow (Slide 6).
3.  **Approve Phase 1:** Secure budget for the Brand Identity & Prototype build.
