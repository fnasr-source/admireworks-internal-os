| **No Editorial Content** — zero blog, zero guides, zero education | "Lighting Academy" + Before/After gallery |
| **Generic Support** — WhatsApp = helpdesk, not expert advice | Named stylists, video call consultations |
| **No B2B/Project Division** — retail only | Dedicated "Projects KSA" arm for hospitality |
| **Return Friction** — customer pays shipping on returns | "Safe Arrival Guarantee" (free replacement) |
