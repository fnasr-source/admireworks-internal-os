# Decision Summary - February 16, 2026

## What Changed In This Meeting
- Positioning shifted from broad lighting opportunity to a tighter, high-value niche:
  - Mosque and project chandeliers (Islamic and large-format project work)
- Main concern is not design only; it is predictable lead generation and ROI.
- The client asked for practical, cost-effective acquisition channels and clear tracking.

## Agreed Commercial Framing
- Partnership model remains available.
- Fixed non-partnership options are required and were explicitly validated:
  - Option B: 45,000 EGP one-time
  - Option C: 35,000 EGP setup + 17,500 EGP/month

## Recommended Start Option (For This Case)
Recommended: Option C (Fixed Optimize, No Sharing) for 3 months.

Why:
- Client explicitly wants execution support in performance and lead generation, not only a one-time build.
- Option C gives enough runway to test channels and optimize based on data.
- Keeps ownership 100% with client and avoids equity/profit-sharing concerns at this stage.

## Baseline GTM (First 90 Days)
1. Channel 1: High-intent search (Arabic/English project keywords)
2. Channel 2: Direct outreach (LinkedIn + email + WhatsApp sequence)
3. Channel 3: Referral activation from existing project network
4. Channel 4: Selective event/project-list outreach

## KPI Baseline (Initial Tracking)
- Qualified leads per month
- Cost per qualified lead by channel
- Meetings booked
- Quotations issued
- Win rate by segment

## Immediate Next Step
- Send revised proposal with explicit "Recommended Start: Option C".
- Ask for written confirmation and kickoff slot.
- Start with briefing + ICP + offer architecture in Week 1.
